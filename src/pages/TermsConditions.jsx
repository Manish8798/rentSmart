              product to the customer on payment of the rent to RentSmart and
              thus the customer is the deemed owner of the usage rights of the
              good. In no way this contract signifies that the good(s) belong to
              you on a permanent basis and the same has to be returned back to
              RentSmart in the original condition in which it was delivered to

              In case of any damage or missing product(s), the company will
              inform you of the same upon receiving back the product. The
              customer agrees to pay for any damage to, loss of, or any theft
              (disappearance) of items, regardless of cause or fault.

            <h3>What is considered damage?</h3>
            <p>
              Any permanent change in the physical appearance of the product or
              any change or loss of functionality of the product is considered
              as damage. Minor wear & tear due to the general usage of the
              product is not considered as damage.
            </p>

            <h3>Deposit Deduction</h3>
            <p>
              If the product rented by you qualifies to be considered as damage,
              the damage cost will be deducted from the security deposit paid by
              the customer. In case the damage or loss of the product is greater
              than the amount of security deposit, the customer will be
              responsible.

              If the product quality check is complete without any reports of
              damage to the product, the whole amount of refundable deposit will
              be refunded to the customer without any interest within 3 working
              days of the receipt of goods.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              All customers must complete a verification process as set by the
              company. Verification can be completed by the customer before or
              after placing the order. The order will be confirmed only once the
              verification is approved. This is only to ensure the safety &
              security of the products rented out by the company. RentSmart may
              ask you to do the following verifications:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Identity verification using Aadhar / driving license / passport
              </li>
              <li>
                Occupation verification using official email / employee ID /
                business card / social media handle
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One of the verifications (identity or occupation) needs to be done
              via OTP method to successfully verify your identity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The customer grants RentSmart permission to obtain their credit
              information from Credit Information Companies (such as Recordent
              Private Limited or the likes) for the purpose of assessing their
              creditworthiness and providing personalized product offerings.
            </p>
            <p>
              In case the verification is not completed by the customer or is
              not satisfactory, RentSmart reserves the right to cancel the
              order. In such an event, any payment done by the customer will be
              refunded back to the customer within 3 working days.
